## Features and Benefits

### Timeline views

Vue provides five built-in timeline views: timeline day, timeline week, timeline workweek, timeline month, and timeline year. Each view displays events accurately across a horizontal time axis for a single day or multiple days.

### Inline appointment

With this feature enabled, users can create and edit appointments inline through a single click on the scheduler cells or on the existing appointmentâ€™s subject. Pressing Enter after the new subject text is typed in the inline text box will update and save the appointment appropriately.

### Unique view configurations

Easily configure each individual view mode with different calendar settings. For example, you can enable the grouping feature in month view and apply event templates in week view.
